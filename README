sanskrit7

This program converts from a 7 bit ASCII transliteration of Sanskrit into
the International Alphabet for Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST), represented
using Unicode.

The 7 bit transliteration is a non-standard scheme used by Jeroen Hellingman
at Distributed Proofreaders (https://www.pgdp.net). It is not the same as the
7 bit encoding defined in ISO 15919 "Transliteration of Devanagari and related
Indic scripts into Latin characters".

The characters to be converted are expected to be encoded between a start
tag ("[SA:", "[DV:", or "[HI:") and an end tag ("]"). Characters in the input
that are not enclosed bewteen these tags are passed through unchanged, discarded,
or converted to upper case, depending on the command line options (see below).

(SA stands for Sanskrit, DV stands for Devanagari, and HI stands for Hindi.
This program treats them identically, but later stages in a processing pipeline
might want to treat Sanskrit and Hindi differently).

Command line options:

-a Characters that are not between tags are copied to the output
-u Characters that are not between tags are converted to upper case and copied
   to the output
-t The tags are copied to the output
